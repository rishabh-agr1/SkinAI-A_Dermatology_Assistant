# SkinAI - A Dermatology Assistant

Developed on December 2024. SkinAI is a dermatology assistant project with a website and a machine learning module. The website, built using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, allows users to diagnose skin conditions, learn about them, and contact doctors if needed.

The machine learning model classifies user-uploaded skin images into seven disease categories with probability scores. It utilizes the HAM10000 labeled dataset from Harvard and applies preprocessing techniques to improve accuracy. Developed with TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Sklearn, and Streamlit, the model achieved 86-87% accuracy during testing. SkinAI aims to provide an accessible, AI-powered tool for early skin disease detection and awareness.

## Features

1. **Skin Disease Diagnosis** – Users can upload skin images for AI-based classification into seven disease types with probability scores.
2. **High-Accuracy ML Model** – Uses a CNN-based deep learning model trained on the HAM10000 dataset, achieving 86-87% accuracy.
3. **Image Preprocessing** – Enhances model performance by applying preprocessing techniques for better classification accuracy.
4. **Educational Resources** – Users can learn about skin conditions, symptoms, and precautions through the website.
5. **Doctor Consultation** – Provides an option to contact dermatologists for further medical advice if needed.

## Technology Used

**Frontend:** HTML, Bootstrap, Javascript
