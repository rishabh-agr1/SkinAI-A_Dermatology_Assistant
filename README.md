# SkinAI - A Dermatology Assistant

SkinAI is a dermatology assistant project with a website and a machine learning module. The website, built using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, allows users to diagnose skin conditions, learn about them, and contact doctors if needed.

The machine learning model classifies user-uploaded skin images into seven disease categories with probability scores. It utilizes the HAM10000 labeled dataset from Harvard and applies preprocessing techniques to improve accuracy. Developed with TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Sklearn, and Streamlit, the model achieved 86-87% accuracy during testing. SkinAI aims to provide an accessible, AI-powered tool for early skin disease detection and awareness.
